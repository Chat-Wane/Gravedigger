Description
-----------
Gravedigger is a plateformer game where the main character, a gravedigger,
tries to keep his job. Indeed, the scientists recently discovered a way to 
brutally improve the life expectancy of the human kind. As a consequence, the 
corpses become rare. Gravediggers lose in utility. Tackling this problem, 
Gravedigger starts a mighty quest to discover a holy virus. He hopes that, 
with the epidemic, the flow of corpses should be back...  

Introduction
------------
Outside the cathedral, the three gravediggers have a meeting. Today, they
have no corpse to burry. Worried about their future, they are looking for a
solution. They come out with two: create the bodies themselves, or unleash
the legendary virus held in the depths of the cathedral.

The two companions of Gravedigger are skeptical about the legendary virus.
First, they think that viruses are only myths to frighten children. Second,
they think that exploring the basements of the cathedral will only result
in three body: their.

On the edge, they decide to apply both solutions. One of the companion
sharpens his knife to rampage in the city at night. The other stays, too
afraid to make any move. Finally, Gravedigger choses to investigate on the
holy virus. Therefore, he runs into the cathedral, aiming for the crypts...

Cathedral
---------
A hanged monk is the cathedral keeper. He is not a fighter and will not
try to stop Gravedigger in his quest. However, he warns him about the
dangers of the crypts. Many have tried to explore the hidden secrets of
the cathedral, but few have survived to tell about it, and none stayed
mentally sane. When Gravedigger describes the purpose of his quest, 
the monk explains that 5 crypts do exist, and he will have to roam them
all to gather the 5 relics that will open the chest hidden under the altar
of the cathedral. Inside, he should find what he searches.

The five crypts are open. However, Gravedigger is not sure about the order
of exploration. Maybe his shovel is not enough to handle the demonic hordes
lying under this building. Maybe he could find equipements dropped by dead 
adventurers which would help him in the other crypts. The esoteric numbers
above the gates may help him to chose. Without certainty, he enters in the
crypt numbered X...

Crypt 1: The Butcher's pit
--------------------------
As expected, the crypt is ungulfed in the darkness. Some torches ("Who put
them here?!") hardly enlighten the only corridor leading into the depths.
Not really reassured, Gravedigger starts his journey. First, he will 
encounter undead: holy people of old ages and their personnal guards.
Gravedigger will force them to rest again. In a second time, he will find
the butcher's pit. The Butcher and his crew have set their base here.
They redecorated the crypt for their own usage. Contrarily to the undeads,
they have modern weapons: pistols, grenades. Additionnaly, they are equipped
of short range melee weapon like daggers, brass knuckles, and clubs. Once
the butcher's crew butchered, Gravedigger will fight the Butcher himself.
Of course, the Butcher is faster and meaner. Gravedigger will have a 
tough fight to obtain the first relic: a piece of meat shaped as a little
boy.

Return 1: a story inside the story
----------------------------------
Gravedigger returns triomphally from the first crypt. "It should be no big 
deal after all"- he says. The <human clone made of meat> has pride of place 
on the altar. Four relics to come...

During the journey, the black cat that silently followed Gravedigger inside
the cathedral is now housed inside the boxes that were lying there. Also,
the hanged monk fell from the luster. He firstly congratulates the hero and
then, he miserably asks Gravedigger to take him away from the black monster.

Finally, Gravedigger must make a second choice. Which gate will he cross
this time?
