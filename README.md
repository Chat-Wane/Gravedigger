Description
===========
Gravedigger is a plateformer game where the main character, a gravedigger,
tries to keep his job. Indeed, the scientists recently discovered a way to 
brutally improve the life expectancy of the human kind. As a consequence, the 
corpses become rare. Gravediggers lose in utility. Tackling this problem, 
Gravedigger starts a mighty quest to discover a holy virus. He hopes that, 
with the epidemic, the flow of corpses should be back...  

Introduction
============
Outside the cathedral, the three gravediggers have a meeting. Today, they
have no corpse to burry. Worried about their future, they are looking for a
solution. They come out with two: create the bodies themselves, or unleash
the legendary virus held in the depths of the cathedral.

The two companions of Gravedigger are skeptical about the legendary virus.
First, they think that viruses are only myths to frighten children. Second,
they think that exploring the basements of the cathedral will only result
in three body: their.

On the edge, they decide to apply both solutions. One of the companion
sharpens his knife to rampage in the city at night. The other stays, too
afraid to make any move. Finally, Gravedigger choses to investigate on the
holy virus. Therefore, he runs into the cathedral, aiming for the crypts...

Cathedral
=========
A hanged monk is the cathedral keeper. He is not a fighter and will not
try to stop Gravedigger in his quest. However, he warns him about the
dangers of the crypts. Many have tried to explore the hidden secrets of
the cathedral, but few have survived to tell about it, and none stayed
mentally sane. When Gravedigger describes the purpose of his quest, 
the monk explains that 5 crypts do exist, and he will have to roam them
all to gather the 5 relics that will open the chest hidden under the altar
of the cathedral. Inside, he should find what he searches.

The five crypts are open. However, Gravedigger is not sure about the order
of exploration. Maybe his shovel is not enough to handle the demonic hordes
lying under this building. Maybe he could find equipements dropped by dead 
adventurers which would help him in the other crypts. The esoteric numbers
above the gates may help him to chose. Without certainty, he enters in the
crypt numbered X...
